# Change Detection Models

This repository contains implementations of several **deep learningâ€“based change detection algorithms** for remote sensing and computer vision tasks.  
Each model is organized into its own folder with dataset handling, training, and utility scripts.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

change_detection_models/

attunet/   #Attention U-Net

raunet/   #Residual Attention U-Net
unetpp/   #U-Net++
changeformer/   #ChangeFormer (Transformer-based model)
bit/   #BIT (Bitemporal Image Transformer)

Each subfolder contains:
- `dataset.py` â€“ Dataset loading and preprocessing  
- `model.py` â€“ Model architecture  
- `train.py` â€“ Training pipeline  
- `utils.py` â€“ Helper functions  
- `Dockerfile` â€“ For reproducible builds  
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Python dependencies

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kabraashish789/change_detection_models.git
cd change_detection_models
2. Build the Docker image
Each model folder has its own Dockerfile. Example for Attention U-Net:

bash
Copy code
cd attunet
docker build -t attunet .
3. Run the container
bash
Copy code
docker run -it --rm attunet
4. Train the model
Inside the container:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
ðŸ§© Available Models
Attention U-Net (attunet/) â€“ U-Net with attention gates for improved feature selection

Residual Attention U-Net (raunet/) â€“ Combines residual connections and attention

U-Net++ (unetpp/) â€“ Nested U-Net with dense skip connections

ChangeFormer (changeformer/) â€“ Transformer-based architecture for change detection

BIT (bit/) â€“ Bitemporal Image Transformer

ðŸ“Š Model Comparison
The following table compares the performance of different change detection models implemented in this repository:

Model	Dice Score	Accuracy (%)
Attention U-Net	0.9483	99.94
Residual Attention U-Net	0.9525	99.95
U-Net++	0.9238	99.91
ChangeFormer	0.9106	99.89
BIT	0.8393	99.81

âš¡ Residual Attention U-Net achieved the highest Dice Score and Accuracy among the tested models.

ðŸ“¦ Requirements
Each model has a requirements.txt with its dependencies. To install locally (without Docker):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
ðŸ“Š Datasets
You can plug in your own change detection dataset (bi-temporal image pairs + labels).
Update dataset.py in the respective model folder to point to your dataset.
